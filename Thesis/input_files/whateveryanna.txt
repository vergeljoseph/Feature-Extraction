i feel like today is a lucky day but tonight not so much
i should have better control of myself starting now
i am at this point of my life that watching late night show of james corden makes me sane
i should not work when i am too sleepy
so i accidentally said fuck in front of a customer kill me kill me now
i am craving for giligan sinigang na baboy
you say you wanna chase the moon like fire well together we can fake our own deaths here
so thankful for the people around me thank you for everything guys
i should not make any decisions right now i swear
i think i need something to refresh
