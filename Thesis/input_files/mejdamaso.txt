stay strong you guys please
i thought i already accepted your death but seeing your cast being held by shinee made me lose it farewell please be at peace
i do not know if this is a routine or caused by panic every monday
when it is time for us to meet again tell me i worked hard too
farewell & may you rest in peace
demons are real yet they have no real form they talk inside our heads they talk and talk and talk and talk but as soon as you give in it is over depression is a demon dwelling inside of us do not let it win talk to your friends family to someone
