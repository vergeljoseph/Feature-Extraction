my whole body hurts
year end plot twist just happened
i do not even have a choice
merry christmas
i am walking into 2018 with a clear heart and mind if you owe me do not worry about it you are welcome if you wronged me it’s all good lesson learned if you are angry with me you have won if we aren’t speaking it’s cool i wish you well & if wronged you i apologize
somewhat a poem yet not even close to rhymes a disoriented paragraph with unfinished sentences a complete statement with no period in it it is not deep but somehow it bleeds i am not broken and i know something's wrong i guess it is love leaving me again
surprisingly i am enjoying having less friends
