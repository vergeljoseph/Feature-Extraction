I’m walking into 2018 with a clear heart and mind. If you owe me, don’t worry about it- you’re welcome. If you wronged me, it’s all good- lesson learned. If you’re angry with me, you’ve won. If we aren’t speaking it’s cool- I wish you well. & if wronged you, I apologize.
Somewhat a poem, yet not even close to rhymes. A disoriented paragraph, with unfinished sentences. A complete statement with no period in it. It's not deep, but somehow it bleeds. I'm not broken and I know something's wrong. I guess it's love. Leaving me again. -Ink
