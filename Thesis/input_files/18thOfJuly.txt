home
finding ramon
true
just woke up
cold summer nights
five hours vacant
do the research bitch haha
dying inside
we just saw two shooting stars
until you reach the ground
deep convos anyone talk to me
bonfire tent stargazing indie songs what a a night
you you are my four leaf clover
oh you cannot see my worth
the hills have eyes
san antonio again
fuck my life
not okay
i came i saw i got rejected
i am both happy and sad
she is strong but she is exhausted
tip of the day stop giving everyone the privilege of knowing everything about you quietly progress
i was dying inside to hold you
i need a break i deserve it
and we never talked again
i dont want us to be strangers again
efforts go unnoticed what is new
i apologize in advance if i may have reached the point of i dont care anymore and indifference i simply stopped overlooking the more important things in life
imagine paul singing hericane while looking at dua lipa with someone else suddenly dua lipa looks at him in the eyes and paul started singing i love you still i always will even though you are wrong
