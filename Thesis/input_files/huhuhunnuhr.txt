it has begun
you are losing your english brace yourself
cannot breathe right what the fuck
our washing machine eats cardigans i swear i had three of them once
i will never get over how much variety the beatles songs have like on the one hand you have i have seen that face
i am home alone and you all know what this means
instant macaroni and cheese is disgusting how do white people like this
i am sorry
a gentle reminder to everyone
you know what is funny the same students who walked out and had their protests are the same ones who taught lumad students gave them temporary shelter when they went here in manila and fought for the rights and justice for lumad people
