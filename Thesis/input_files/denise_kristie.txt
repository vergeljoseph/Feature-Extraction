my boyfriend wants the stories i wrote for him printed does he realize i have 6 stories written so far and the longest is 72 pages
she looks sort of like she has been born in the wrong decade
she yanks the hood from her head and denise eyes redirect across her face she is striking in a sort of strange way
denise is at that level of buzzed that transcends time and space
she pulls her hair in a messy bun with one arm while the other unlocks the door and swings it open she does not recognize the person on the other side hi
it was sunday morning when her doorbell rings in the midst of her smoking a joint she exhales a plume of smoke and drags it out blooming thick o from her split mouth before stumbling to the mirror by the doorway
i got carried away writing
i will be writing these from my point of view of how i see you you may or may not agree but perception is abundant i apologize for my writing in advance if it is not to your fancy i will also pick and choose only thanks guys
fuck me up i will never finish this but i want to do it so bad
