hi this is for you i hope you realize it
me to my grades i talk to god about you
what’s the point of a relationship if you all ain’t gonna get married later in future it is just a waste of time and efforts to be honest
you don’t have to be great to start but you do have to start to be great
what do you gain by regularly praying to god nothing but let me tell what i lost anger ego greed depression insecurity sometimes the answer to our prayers is not gaining but losing which ultimately is the gain

i value handwritten letters and holding hands forehead kisses and long text messages so much you should not let those die just because a new generation is born i am a sucker for old school romance oh shit
being in someone prayers is the purest form of real love
