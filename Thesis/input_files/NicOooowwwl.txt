so what will i eat for lunch
daughter duties before classes start
half day and i am enrolled 
how can i help you
making my new path in life
accidentally sent the message to the little brother
when i pay to my bestfriends i only pay the bills not the coins
been disturbing you every day
i am a weak shit these days
went upstairs to sleep but ended coming down and opened my laptop 
my tummy is going crazy 
one day it won't hurt anymore
why does it have to rain on those who deserve sunshine the most
why is it so hard to trust people
why is it so hard to keep a promise
you cant expect someone to love you back
i will always remember you ignored my texts
