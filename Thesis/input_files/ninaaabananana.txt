i wanna be with you
what did i do to deserve oasis
sometimes we suddenly feel down for no apparent reason
something is wrong with me again i suddenly want to cry for no apparent reason
you are really missing out
i have done my part
so much drama is going on
life is weird
anyone interested to help us out
not all guys are fucking dogs who just care about getting laid
i did not think it was possible to give up on myself
quit making me cry damn
