it is so frustrating when you are giving it your all yet you are still not appreciated
can i cry all of this
that moment when you try to do it but you relly cant
i know i will never be good enough for you and that honestly sucks
i have realized so many things today
i am barely sober what the fuck
i see myself in her position and having the same reaction
so much more than this
i am a fool
i do not want to expect but it is hard not to
thank you
it was fun
you are what i want
we were lovers for the first time
fun buddies
aint no fucking way
actions speak louder than words
that was impulsive
a guy that cares about what you think is greater than insensitive dicks
i am just trying to be somebody
it is kind of funny how people stare at you and they expect you to cower and when you dont
i like you
some nights you dance with tears in your eyes
okay guys we should leave behind all of our judgmental thoughts behind in 2017 no to negativity this 2018
cannot wait for the year where i can finally have my new years kiss with the person i want to spend my whole life with
too young to stop but old enough to know the limit
starve ourselves to death just to be accepted by society
the roughness of his hands
something made my night last night
how can you expect us to act like adults when you treat us like children
it is starting to get annoying how others look down on people who have vices
what the fuck
and i am so sick of love songs
imagine being loved by the person who you love deeply what a concept
in love
it is hard to believe
give me a memory i can use
imagine living in a small apartment with your soulmate and not worrying about paying the bills and being happy because you are both working your dream job and just not worrying about a damn thing in this crazy world what a concept
i honestly do not know why i instantly get insecure when the person i like likes another girl selfie or bikini pictures
half-assed efforts
all i ask
the battle will never end
it is never easy
my eyes are peeing
it is not easy to comfort someone with depression
it was bittersweet honey
it is almost two and i do not know what to do should i stay or should i go without you i am feeling low i am thinking about us
real love is never a waste of time
i feel so bad
it is what you do to me
times square cannot shine as bright as you
what was once lost cannot be found
ever since the day i met you
you need someone you adore
i cant believe that i could be so blind
you are too close
i gave my heart to a goddamn fool
do not make this all about you
i want to be with someone who never makes me doubt if he is being real or not
he tells her that she is nothing like the last one despite her past
because every time i see you i get nervous
real friends
