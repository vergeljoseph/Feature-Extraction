someone is back
and no i am not dyeing it weird i am just cutting it short so much hate
i swear my mother makes a big deal out of hair it is fucking hair
we dream of a brand new start but we dream in the dark for the most part
have yet to experience the perfect nap goddamn my head hurts
i may be deflowered but i am not devalued
i should stop trying to learn new hobbies at least until i graduate
thighs are jelly after riding bicycle
watched rogue one again always right in the goddamn kokoro
past 5 days staycation my kind of holiday
