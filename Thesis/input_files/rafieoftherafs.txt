i am home and i already wanna go back to ilocos
why must you always flatter my little heart
fucking love that movie
i wonder how much my perspective of the world would change if i switched eyeballs with someone.
i picked books over games this sembreak the tall stack of books in my room is calling me
happy holidays rest up this christmas break you deserve it
i wanna make a cover of i dreamed a dream
i was supposed to work on org shit
glad to see that some things never change you are still a petty fucking idiot
why do the people in this house not realize that i do not want small talk while i am so damn into the book i am reading
