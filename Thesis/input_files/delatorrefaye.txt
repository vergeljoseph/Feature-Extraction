i value handwritten letters and holding hands forehead kisses and long text messages so much you should not let those die just because a new generation is born i am a sucker for old school romance oh shit
decide today that you won't give up on your dreams and desires keep pressing forward believing that you are anointed and empowered
did i really deserve this communications 3 grade thanks miss arong
i forgot my eyeglasses at home
literally crying like the weakshit that i am why
what happened to us i waited yeah for like a month
someone committed suicide at the mall mental health is very important
i do not want you spending a lot of money on me handwritten notes and letters will be the best forever and ever and ever i will never get tired of receiving those
