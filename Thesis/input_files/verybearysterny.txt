gonna sleep this hunger
i have no future sad life
gonna lose something
i will bleed if i have to
got a free salad and mango float
i will just keep myself busy as what i used to do
i never failed you ever
i won't run away anymore no matter how shaken it gets you always run with all your might in the end and we always end up standing in front of this beach hiding how we truly feel my one and only wish i pray until it reaches you it reaches you it reaches you
