today has been the longest fucking day of my life and i just want to go to sleep forever
stopped working for a hour while i was trying to watch and i actually cried because that is the kind of day i have had lol
feeling very defeated lately no matter how hard i try
i had plans to see a good friend when she stops here on tour and now i have to work literally so bummed
missing someone who could care less about you is one of the shittiest feelings in the world
not being able to eat literally anything besides top ramen and crackers is driving me insane a bite of anything else makes me so sick
today has been rough i have been so happy lately but right now i am just an emo mess and nothing is helping me feel better
its real i cry
