every smile you fake
how do you stay motivated with routinary work
patience is key but i am done witj being patient towards everybody
these are the days when i feel so happy at one moment and then sink into the dark pits of hell thinking i do not deserve to be happy or satisfied at all
about to make wrong decisions again
god help the allergic nose
i am just a poor girl nobody loves me
