i will always appreciate you
i love you like how the ocean loves the shore
feeling like a baby girl because someone picked me up from work
lord help i am sleepyah the translation kinda makes me sound depressed
do your little magic
always here to support you
to all mental health awareness advocates
we are actually just sitting on the floor to get good background
it is okay it is okay to stop talking
i write to let it out
givers need to set limits because takers rarely do
then embrace it until the brokenness becomes a void that would not be able to overpower you anymore
sometimes you just need a break from everything
me it is okay
me to self why have lashes extensions when you can take care of your own lashes also you cannot afford shit too high maintenance
arguments and fucking fights every fucking christmas well
my drug is my baby
do not compare your chapter 1 to someone else chapter 20
