the next ti ame i get hell drunk someone needs to like hide my phone i fucking called and texted i do not know how many people last ti ame
i want a dog so i can bug my dog all the ti ame and it can get annoyed of me
i am going to be so mad if my phone is not sending text messages omg
i am gonna make myself cry if i keep watching these fucking videos
i regret eating 4 fat slices of pizza omg
fuck that was awkward
i despise anxiety
i need a tight hug to cry
i need a hug
my day went to shit
why does my head have to do this to me
wait did we fuck that up
i miss hi am so much to be honest
girls are being so nice to me today
i am available
please dont lie to me
somebody be my friend
i am sleepy
what the fuck
thank you
i am pretty disappointed in that look ugh
about to recreate another look
it is gonna be okay it is gonna be okay it is gonna be okay it is gonna be okay it is gonna be okay
i am happy now
i hated myself after because i tried to get her back but she turned me down and i would give her flowers and write her cute shit and she ended up moving on but it makes me sad because she was there for me last year after my last breakup
back in middle school i felt really bad because my ex girlfriend was heavily all about me but i felt too afraid of being with her (dont know why because my mom used to be with a female so why would she hate on me) but i ended up breaking her heart eh
i dont need friends that are gonna make me temporary dont even bother if youre not planning to stick around
i always believe people are lying to me no matter what
i am so confused i do not know what to believe
honest to god if you want to be my friend just skip the awkward phase send me a meme and call me a bitch do it in the name of friendship
pats my own shoulder it is gonna be okay dumb bitch
you ever be like oh wow i am crazy
i hope for at least one more big 4 show before the end of slayerâ€™s final tour it just would not be right anyone else with me
i envy you people who do not have a fucked up family
how is someone supposed to trust when they are constantly lied to 
how is someone supposed to stay loyal when they keep getting betrayed
how is someone supposed to think straight when they keep getting switched up on 
just want y ouall to remember i will fight any of you
