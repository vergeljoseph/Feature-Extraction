i really wish that more people understood this one thing i try and tell them. unfortunately so many people do not understand it do you depression mental health awareness bipolar
mental health anxiety insomnia bruised minds
now i amm singing casting crowns thrive in my head lol but i take your point well
having a parent with depression is not easy
gripping ice is meant to be really effective
mental health anxiety insomnia bruised minds
i have heard it is hard to diagnose that way
i will get the case made
i have about 4 or 5 different gps because they seem to rotate patients in the surgery the mental health consultant agreed there were elements of it but he was not qualified enough to give a firm opinion.
i have seen the same psychiatrist twice now and brought it up both times
well
i shall pester the doctor then see what he can do otherwise i am seen every four months by the same one did you get a second opinion on yours
i have had it before i was put on the sertraline
i will take it up with them just amazed at how long a referral for a second opinion takes if i was still self-harming and the thoughts have crossed my mind every day then i could be in trouble
the therapist did not see the need for it as he believes it is still regular depression he seems to think therapy is the key to solving this
how did you break that cycle the trouble i find is that rapid cycling bipolar
it is a starting point i just want a doctor to listen and take the idea seriously instead of just dismissing it
i shall look now
you are bipolar i just think that this is not normal depression
i do try and help others because no one should have to go through this alone
i am depressed too
i am definitely going to get a second opinion
does what i describe sound a lot like bipolar to you
it is not bad it is not a great coping mechanism
understanding self-harm can be difficult for those who have not experienced it why do people do it what do they get from it what can i do to help while each case will be different from person to person
from what i understood from it
i thought the two were more mutually exclusive
it definitely is
thank you
do not worry
the first link is sending me round in circles
as in a few weeks of hypermanic and a few weeks of depression
280 characters does not leave me a lot to describe it well
ok do you know if i can push for it
i have the anxiety but i am not convinced it is that that causes it
no family history of bipolar
you're welcome you are right
thanks for responding
thank you
mental health anxiety insomnia bruised minds
it might be i will need to look into it to see whether it fits thank you

it certainly can be the biggest challenge i am also trying to be nice but finding that i am irritable and struggling a bit i guess it is just one of those days really
dare i ask
see

i need a little advice i seem to find that my mood will be good and then drop then be good and then drop in a very short space of time therapist says it is depression

a holiday could be quite a good thing you are welcome
it was really good
depression bipolar mental health awareness bruised minds
i am glad it went great
you will recover i know you will
the fact that you have realized that it is a potential problem
i believe everyone has it in them to make the change that they want to make fear can be paralysing but it can also be motivating harness that fear and use it to propel you in a different direction
perhaps break it into manageable chunks if you plan your essays
it is hard
it is not going too badly thanks not on such a hot day but still managing to plod through somehow how about yours
i know what you mean it is so hard for us to ask for help and when depression strikes
i am glad the dogs help and that you have had a couple of quiet days it is days like that that recharge us and help us cope with tomorrow
that is good then

ara thought what when she found out her friend struggled with depression and anxiety

would you dare to believe that you still have a reason to sing the night is always darkest just before the dawn read more depression anxiety mental health awareness
i am impressed
that really sucks gps should be better equipped to handle it
i am glad you manage with them it is something that is apparently quite difficult
i am trying to get it checked to make sure but unfortunately the psychiatrist seems to think otherwise i am going to be getting a second opinion when i can
pills and blades is my struggle against depression
it sucks that that is going to be the case but if that is what you need
i am stable
i know what you mean i find i still have to use medication to manage mine when they tried to take me off
thought i would got that wrong
i am glad sertraline has balanced you out do you get any really negative side-effects from it i find i get stomach cramps if i take it without enough food and a dry mouth toowhich sucks
nothing wrong with just tablets sometimes the gps do need changing over
might have been 45 mg then i confuse the mirtazipine with citalopram
i think it depends on the person if they are able to cope without their meds then by all means
me neither
i went up to 100 mg of mirtazipine before i raised the issue i am now on 150 mg of sertraline
i know what you mean
mirtazipine is not the easiest
i am sorry to hear that i cannot imagine how difficult that must have been
how many mental illnesses come with physical symptoms as well like depression causing headaches and so on it is a difficult thing for people to grasp
i think it would be more of an alleviation of symptoms
it is a difficult one
i am sorry to hear that must be something in the air
that really sucks even though they are on the front lines
i know right too much sugar has never been a problem for me
i am sorry to hear that you are not alone
we should always be kind
i might be misinterpreting this
it is difficult but the best way to get rid of comfortable is to become uncomfortable challenging them to do things might be good
so true
it can be so beneficial even if you cannot achieve whatever it is you want to achieve
it is a horrible feeling i am sorry things are not good is there anything i can do to help
it is sad that mental health even needs to be normalised why should it be any less important than physical health why should people treat it any differently i agree
as much as i appreciate the sentiment
absolutely one of my friends had an absolutely awful encounter with a gp
thank you
i am glad things are that bit better for you also glad the calm has helped i find calm and my partner help me as well
thank you
it is good that you do this too many people are not aware of the support around them
thank you can i use that in a blog post
we may have to agree to disagree on this one then
if i was to ask you what your expectations were/are when you hear about mental health or bipolar or insomnia
i am sorry to hear things are stressful is there anything i can do to help
i have done it
now that sounds good to me last year
it is great to see organisations signposting people to local organisations in the area we need more things like this out there
it looks good
it can be so difficult to talk about mental health with stigma still a big part of it
it is never as simple as mere depression
