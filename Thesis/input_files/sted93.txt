it is ok to fall
just do not ever forget to keep trying to move forward
when it is friday night and everyone is like yay let us go partying and i am all like yay
i do not know i really like party very much
i am on a rollercoaster
i cannot sleep
it is gonna be ok
i am pretty sure we need to touch the lowest ground to be totally able to get back up again
it really means more than i can say right now
thank you for these words
when those doubts are too strong
i am grateful and destroyed at the same time
depression does not mean i am always sad
i am okay
depression tells you you are hopeless and nothing is ever gonna change
you do not feel stronger because depression is like a veil that covers our potential keep fighting
it is not good to keep toxic people in your life
depression is to feel emotionally drained after overthinking about something
stay alive please
that makes us feel very good as well
that is exactly what fucks my mind
stealing is always intentional
and here we go again
i cannot stand this anymore
it is pretty tiring
i am just so tired
i seriously cannot believe it
keep going
music seems to fill the emptiness i sometimes feel inside
i m trying to change the perspective from which i look at anything that happens to me
i wish i did not trust another person who only tear my heart into pieces
it is ok to feel that way
depression is like a misty maze where you are stuck deep inside
bad experiences change our life i met panic attacks
my life was never the same after that
if someone keeps hurting and disappointing you
i totally understand that
that makes you a great
you are not alone
keep fighting for yourself
this is seriously beautiful
you two are beautiful
i personally think that depression makes grief harder if that is even possible
depression makes u think you are alone and nobody understands you
depression is to feel even more powerless when people call you lazy because they do not understand you are sick
depression is to get up from the bed to go lay on your sofa because you literally have no strength
depression is a mental illness
