it was beautiful thank you
my crush is such an attentive person it hurts
my day has been made thank you love you so much 
what time is it again
it has been rigged
still can't get over how this feels like children memory games
nope not overthinking not today
dammit tumblr is such a gold mine of memes and beautiful photos
my god anime
i cant even enjoy my sleep
my sweet brother who i am writing an essay about feminism for
why were clothes ever invented
my brother is so sweet pero i cant even do this for him
when i said i wanted to feel
why is feminism in arts hard to write about
rolls around in agony
dearest brother
rolls around in madnessand maybe emotionally scarring so institution it is or free school lolololol cat street plugs right there
they say it is very dramatic
then again i realize i will just be like my parents
these are the times i wish i could be a parent
i feel so bad sometimes for wishing i had really chill parents who did not plan my whole life for me i mean i know they are just concerned but i still wish they could have been this concerned when i was younger and in need of it
this place makes me panic i am not even trying to sleep right now i just am
i love it when my friends tell me stories
i cannot enjoy this yet maybe later
every time i close my eyes it hurts
can i be the person i date next i have so much misplaced love that i have been willing to give it is ridiculous
what if they feel like they are not good enough that is why i am like this
but i do not feel like writing
the earphones will really have to make a comeback
where that make a sad person happy by turning them into sushi rolls group of pics
note to self if the day is already bad enough
i hope you have a good read
because being okay is never actually okay it is just tucked in the back of my head
but sometimes i also want to stop trying to be okay
will somebody tell me a story tomorrow
so no words for tonight
it will be alright love it has always been we will even wear that big stupid jacket you love
one of these days
take your time and take care of yourself too
what is this upside down
he's still lying
it is done
last for two days
kids are scary
it is okay to not be part of the equation
i hope you are too good luck
when we do it is in the form of ridicule 
trying to save a kitten with an absentee mother using a small syringe and lactose free milk lol good luck to us
