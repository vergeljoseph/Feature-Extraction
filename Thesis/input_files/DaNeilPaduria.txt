looking forward and staying positive
it must be done
i have no other choice
let the hunger games begin
happy day indeed it was
now i understand what they meant
all i can do is hope and be patient
broken promises
kids with strict parents know the struggle of explaining to friends why they cannot come to spontaneous trips and out of town adventures heck even just late night outs in the city it is so sad to miss all the fun but someday friends someday babawi ako sa inyo and to myself
