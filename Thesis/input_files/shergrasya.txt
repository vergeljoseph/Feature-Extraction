fuck season 5 is breaking my heart all over gain
damn i think im just going to accept the fact that i am going to gain weight over the break

i have never seen our table filled with so many pastries im hyperventilating
i am pretty sure he is here for somebody

nothing good really happens at this ungodly hour for example
sometimes i forget that i once had a boyfriend
i am finally getting rid of that semestral stress after that relaxing face mask session
face masks are weird

ending this semester with a glass of gin
