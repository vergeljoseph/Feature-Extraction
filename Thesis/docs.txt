efforts go unnoticed what is new
i apologize in advance if i may have reached the point of i dont care anymore and indifference i simply stopped overlooking the more important things in life

make your own recovery the first priority in your life
going after a dream has a price it may mean abandoning our habits it may make us go through hardships or it may lead us to disappointment but however costly it is never as high as the price paid by people who live in his or her comfort zone
i discussed one of the most neglected causes of depression and anxiety childhood trauma on one of my favourite news shows
i was interviewed for bbc scotland about depression and anxiety and some specifically scottish relevance in this debate
my anxiety and depression blaming each other

i really wish that more people understood this one thing i try and tell them. unfortunately so many people do not understand it do you depression mental health awareness bipolar
mental health anxiety insomnia bruised minds
now i amm singing casting crowns thrive in my head lol but i take your point well
having a parent with depression is not easy
gripping ice is meant to be really effective
mental health anxiety insomnia bruised minds
i have heard it is hard to diagnose that way
i will get the case made
i have about 4 or 5 different gps because they seem to rotate patients in the surgery the mental health consultant agreed there were elements of it but he was not qualified enough to give a firm opinion.
i have seen the same psychiatrist twice now and brought it up both times
well
i shall pester the doctor then see what he can do otherwise i am seen every four months by the same one did you get a second opinion on yours
i have had it before i was put on the sertraline
i will take it up with them just amazed at how long a referral for a second opinion takes if i was still self-harming and the thoughts have crossed my mind every day then i could be in trouble
the therapist did not see the need for it as he believes it is still regular depression he seems to think therapy is the key to solving this
how did you break that cycle the trouble i find is that rapid cycling bipolar
it is a starting point i just want a doctor to listen and take the idea seriously instead of just dismissing it
i shall look now
you are bipolar i just think that this is not normal depression
i do try and help others because no one should have to go through this alone
i am depressed too
i am definitely going to get a second opinion
does what i describe sound a lot like bipolar to you
it is not bad it is not a great coping mechanism
understanding self-harm can be difficult for those who have not experienced it why do people do it what do they get from it what can i do to help while each case will be different from person to person
from what i understood from it
i thought the two were more mutually exclusive
it definitely is
thank you
do not worry
the first link is sending me round in circles
as in a few weeks of hypermanic and a few weeks of depression
280 characters does not leave me a lot to describe it well
ok do you know if i can push for it
i have the anxiety but i am not convinced it is that that causes it
no family history of bipolar
you're welcome you are right
thanks for responding
thank you
mental health anxiety insomnia bruised minds
it might be i will need to look into it to see whether it fits thank you
thank you can we get diagnosed with that in the United Kingdom
where would i find one
they did not mention it

what is it like to have a parent with depression
mental health anxiety insomnia bruised minds
understanding self-harm can be difficult
mental health anxiety insomnia bruised minds
if we want to see a change in the world then we have to step up to the mark and we have to make the change it is not a job for anyone else depression mental health awareness
mental health anxiety insomnia bruised minds
we must stop doing this to people who struggle with depression
httdepression bipolar mental health awareness bruised minds
so do i thanks for your help though
well i will definitely take it into account
as hard as it can be to believe
ah got you that is alright
last time i checked
well
what is had i have not come across that one before
it is more helpful than you think
see
it certainly can be the biggest challenge i am also trying to be nice but finding that i am irritable and struggling a bit i guess it is just one of those days really
dare i ask
see
tomorrow is definitely a new day which is funny
i need a little advice i seem to find that my mood will be good and then drop then be good and then drop in a very short space of time therapist says it is depression
there are a bit of balance every now and again would be nice i feel a bit like a yo-yo
a holiday could be quite a good thing you are welcome
it was really good
depression bipolar mental health awareness bruised minds
i am glad it went great
you will recover i know you will
the fact that you have realized that it is a potential problem
i believe everyone has it in them to make the change that they want to make fear can be paralysing but it can also be motivating harness that fear and use it to propel you in a different direction
perhaps break it into manageable chunks if you plan your essays
it is hard
it is not going too badly thanks not on such a hot day but still managing to plod through somehow how about yours
i know what you mean it is so hard for us to ask for help and when depression strikes
i am glad the dogs help and that you have had a couple of quiet days it is days like that that recharge us and help us cope with tomorrow
that is good then
i am sure they will my duvet and my tablet work wonders for me
i am afraid i do not
that is a big accomplishment indeed good luck with the work

it is a really good thing that you do a lot of people need that help and feel like they cannot ask for it as well i
i love saying that i am not normal
sadly this is so true it does not matter whether we have everything or nothing
i am rubbish with a paintbrush but a pen or keyboard work well for me and a guitar

ara thought what when she found out her friend struggled with depression and anxiety

would you dare to believe that you still have a reason to sing the night is always darkest just before the dawn read more depression anxiety mental health awareness
i am impressed
that really sucks gps should be better equipped to handle it
i am glad you manage with them it is something that is apparently quite difficult
i am trying to get it checked to make sure but unfortunately the psychiatrist seems to think otherwise i am going to be getting a second opinion when i can
pills and blades is my struggle against depression
it sucks that that is going to be the case but if that is what you need
i am stable
i know what you mean i find i still have to use medication to manage mine when they tried to take me off
thought i would got that wrong
i am glad sertraline has balanced you out do you get any really negative side-effects from it i find i get stomach cramps if i take it without enough food and a dry mouth toowhich sucks
nothing wrong with just tablets sometimes the gps do need changing over
might have been 45 mg then i confuse the mirtazipine with citalopram
i think it depends on the person if they are able to cope without their meds then by all means
me neither
i went up to 100 mg of mirtazipine before i raised the issue i am now on 150 mg of sertraline
i know what you mean
mirtazipine is not the easiest
i am sorry to hear that i cannot imagine how difficult that must have been
how many mental illnesses come with physical symptoms as well like depression causing headaches and so on it is a difficult thing for people to grasp
i think it would be more of an alleviation of symptoms
it is a difficult one
i am sorry to hear that must be something in the air
that really sucks even though they are on the front lines
i know right too much sugar has never been a problem for me
i am sorry to hear that you are not alone
we should always be kind
i might be misinterpreting this
it is difficult but the best way to get rid of comfortable is to become uncomfortable challenging them to do things might be good
so true
it can be so beneficial even if you cannot achieve whatever it is you want to achieve
it is a horrible feeling i am sorry things are not good is there anything i can do to help
it is sad that mental health even needs to be normalised why should it be any less important than physical health why should people treat it any differently i agree
as much as i appreciate the sentiment
absolutely one of my friends had an absolutely awful encounter with a gp
thank you
i am glad things are that bit better for you also glad the calm has helped i find calm and my partner help me as well
thank you
it is good that you do this too many people are not aware of the support around them
thank you can i use that in a blog post
we may have to agree to disagree on this one then
if i was to ask you what your expectations were/are when you hear about mental health or bipolar or insomnia
i am sorry to hear things are stressful is there anything i can do to help
i have done it
now that sounds good to me last year
it is great to see organisations signposting people to local organisations in the area we need more things like this out there
it looks good
it can be so difficult to talk about mental health with stigma still a big part of it
it is never as simple as mere depression
pills and blades is alex mental health struggle find out how his struggle turned him to self-harm
ending the stigma will benefit so many people
you would think they would have things in place for us to be able to get appointments soon what would happen if it was a serious emergency we need more than just a phone call or to be told to go to
it would be great if pip became something for mental health as well i was turned down for mine because i was able to look after myselfon the good days on the bad days i was hopeless but they did not take that into account
no problem

i teach young children and adults the violin and coach families struggling to cope with mental health i wish your friends family good things with all my heart
make the world more compassionate
you are so kind i like my life better now and look forward to many years of treating everyone in a way that keeps my regrets away
each thursday we are striving to provide a safe place to ask questions anonymously we want a radio show that lessens the fear stigma of mental health topics
i had alienated so many friends and never felt good about myself by hurting others
strange how much i view so many on twitter as friends and family so lucky to know you and so many others that fight bravely for understanding
as someone who was a bully i can say with certainty that life is much more beautiful when you are kind
how about better education and retraining a universal wage sounds good
interesting had not thought of that
he should be brave enough to testify openly and without conditions if he is not fit for testifying without conditions written by his lawyer
beautiful words that need to be stated more often as always
the entire release the memo is hogwash if it proves something
dealing with anxiety over the last few days has been a struggle although i was able to work
can i ask what action deserves the response take your meds and chill out happy to discuss the merits of the memo or hannity
as i have said before please release the memo and have hannity read it live on his show then it cannot be used as a threat
i agree it has no power once people see it i am tired of this memo being weaponized
there is no reason to react to alternative facts hannity trump resign trump gop shutdown
thank you today i needed some hope that this administration can be held accountable it is hard to keep fighting when nothing works thank you again
if they are powerless
he lies that is all our government is good at anymore
let me rephrase if you had any skill and were paying taxes
if you were working in mexico as a doctor and they found out you were there illegally
well stated
he is cutting benifits ptsd soldiers and veterans need
my oldest has been with me through the bad and good times
they are adorable my friend
the world can never have too much kindness or love reach out and show someone you care if they do not want a hug
it does not begin with weed from mexico
who does not that is what makes us human hugs to everyone
oprah cares for the people and she actually knows how to run a successful business she walked a difficult path and rose above it she also can prove she is a billionaire with her tax returns
it just needs to be a person of reason
cannot agree more humanity is not about money or power
where can someone purchase your work i am blown away would love to spread the word anyway i can best to you
they were brought here as children does no one practice what they preach do not try to spin this into a military narrative it offends me and my family members that proudly served just do not go there uncle
this is what happens when you stack endless lies upon each other
hugs and hope we are all here for you ben please reach out anytime and know my direct message is always open
if you are dealing with goals
love this one mutually agreed that kindness and love are the most powerful tools we have to change the world be kind kindness ripples kindness matters tools of compassion
you cannot call it news when it is hannity
i personally do not think i am naturally smart i get recognized as such because i work for it i shit ass work for it my elementary and high school awards i worked for it me getting into up i worked my ass for it because they wanted me to
i have always lived behind the shadows of their dreams for me they wanted me to grow up in a certain way and i did up until i grew consciousness to realize that this is not how i want to live my life anymore
she turned off the light locked her room hugged him and cried her eyes out all night it has been 18 years but her teddy bear never judged her
talk about insensitivity
people usually ask what is your ideal man i just want that connection where you guys talk endlessly and still not get tired of it you see each other all the time but you still get so excited real connection that is harder to find because you do not feel that with everyone you meet
have a great sunday
my classes start at 7:30 am and ends at 7:30 pm today
i learned that you do not always have to show how strong you are in order to be loved

kids with strict parents know the struggle of explaining to friends why they cannot come to spontaneous trips and out of town adventures heck even just late night outs in the city it is so sad to miss all the fun but someday friends someday babawi ako sa inyo and to myself
i value handwritten letters and holding hands forehead kisses and long text messages so much you should not let those die just because a new generation is born i am a sucker for old school romance oh shit

was watching this beautiful creature sleep last night i could only wish to be there and give you my warmest few more days babe a few more
and no one would be there to feel for me
though it was literally a crazy and bumpy ride
woke up to a really bad dream but she called right away to comfort her mushy mushy potato like she always does what a good morning
i hope this 2018 people will realize that not all who smoke and drink are bad people
same dilemma

it sucks to be away from her
the silly impulsive me

my friend deadass sent me a snapchat of her smoking captioned who am i to mock me i hate my friends
the anime orange is so good i am mad there is no season 2

sex is cool but a concept
almost all tweets are the same these days
i am ramona flowers and alaska young mixed
dead
my boyfriend wants the stories i wrote for him printed does he realize i have 6 stories written so far and the longest is 72 pages
she looks sort of like she has been born in the wrong decade
she yanks the hood from her head and denise eyes redirect across her face she is striking in a sort of strange way
denise is at that level of buzzed that transcends time and space
she pulls her hair in a messy bun with one arm while the other unlocks the door and swings it open she does not recognize the person on the other side hi
it was sunday morning when her doorbell rings in the midst of her smoking a joint she exhales a plume of smoke and drags it out blooming thick o from her split mouth before stumbling to the mirror by the doorway
i got carried away writing
i will be writing these from my point of view of how i see you you may or may not agree but perception is abundant i apologize for my writing in advance if it is not to your fancy i will also pick and choose only thanks guys
fuck me up i will never finish this but i want to do it so bad
getting my lashes done today

i am for real trying to be sober the whole 2018
petition to cancel hans obusan for saying warm pusspuss goodbye

cheers to 2017 it was one hell of a year

my housemates firing up loud ass firecrackers here i am deaf and not jolly

i do not know why but i had so many embarrassing moments one i confidently said hi to a guy who was eating his late lunch in casaa cause i thought he someone i know and i can say he had this big question mark in his head of who i even am when i said that he finished his food as if he was in a hurry for class but when i went out of casaa he was just there sitting on the floor hiding and just eating again i think i creeped him out
i am gonna undo what i did and this time i am gonna do the right thing
i am glad my cousin finally opened up to me because our whole family has been having a hard time communicating and expressing what we really wanna convey to him
it is not raining but the grounds are wet and muddy and the surrounding air is just too cold that i had to wear a sweater i did not even sweat walking rapidly from one building to another for my classes which is unbelievable because i always sweat
ohhh i miss cebu and i miss attending sto niño novena masses
told annalice to call me when she is attending the mass so i can hear it with her and sing bato balani even if i am miles away

there was someone in hell kitchen who tried to get ramsay to yell at her and managed to make it happen she kept calling for his attention from the place where the dishes go out and he screamed at her

what’s the point of a relationship if you all ain’t gonna get married later in future it is just a waste of time and efforts to be honest
you don’t have to be great to start but you do have to start to be great
what do you gain by regularly praying to god nothing but let me tell what i lost anger ego greed depression insecurity sometimes the answer to our prayers is not gaining but losing which ultimately is the gain
2017 is almost over i am still fat i have not saved any money i am still ugly
filipino parenting culture is being strict to your child even if they are of right and legal age to decide for themselves and prohibiting them to do things that is not at all bad it is just that you as a conservative filipino parent disagrees with it
don't you hate it when people make a joke about you about something that you are actually incredibly insecure about and they do not realize it but every laugh feels like a stab in your chest because it hurts so much and brings up memories you would rather forget
she is the type of girl that can be so hurt but can still look at you and smile
webmd is where you go when you want to die and you need science to convince you that it is happening soon
i would rather be known for loving too much than loving too little 
hello i accept handwritten letters as a gift for christmas
i value handwritten letters and holding hands forehead kisses and long text messages so much you should not let those die just because a new generation is born i am a sucker for old school romance oh shit
being in someone prayers is the purest form of real love
crap not again
we will get there soon
i am not at liberty to discuss
oh i love warm hugs
it is sunday and i am working what is rest day
we watched the greatest showman last night and i cannot get the soundtrack 
you know i want you it is not a secret i try to hide

you are losing your english brace yourself
cannot breathe right what the fuck
our washing machine eats cardigans i swear i had three of them once
i will never get over how much variety the beatles songs have like on the one hand you have i have seen that face
i am home alone and you all know what this means
instant macaroni and cheese is disgusting how do white people like this
i am sorry
a gentle reminder to everyone

wait anti anxiety wrap for humans
hello anyone interested to adopt a hamster

somewhat a poem yet not even close to rhymes a disoriented paragraph with unfinished sentences a complete statement with no period in it it is not deep but somehow it bleeds i am not broken and i know something's wrong i guess it is love leaving me again
surprisingly i am enjoying having less friends
let us drink tonight
last working day of 2017 let us do this
no traffic in skyway my heart is so happy
it is so frustrating when you are giving it your all yet you are still not appreciated
can i cry all of this
that moment when you try to do it but you relly cant
i know i will never be good enough for you and that honestly sucks
i have realized so many things today
i am barely sober what the fuck
i see myself in her position and having the same reaction
so much more than this
i am a fool
i do not want to expect but it is hard not to
thank you
it was fun
you are what i want
we were lovers for the first time
fun buddies
aint no fucking way
actions speak louder than words
that was impulsive
a guy that cares about what you think is greater than insensitive dicks
i am just trying to be somebody
it is kind of funny how people stare at you and they expect you to cower and when you dont
i like you
some nights you dance with tears in your eyes
okay guys we should leave behind all of our judgmental thoughts behind in 2017 no to negativity this 2018
cannot wait for the year where i can finally have my new years kiss with the person i want to spend my whole life with
too young to stop but old enough to know the limit
starve ourselves to death just to be accepted by society
the roughness of his hands
something made my night last night
how can you expect us to act like adults when you treat us like children
it is starting to get annoying how others look down on people who have vices
what the fuck
and i am so sick of love songs
imagine being loved by the person who you love deeply what a concept
in love
it is hard to believe
give me a memory i can use
imagine living in a small apartment with your soulmate and not worrying about paying the bills and being happy because you are both working your dream job and just not worrying about a damn thing in this crazy world what a concept
i honestly do not know why i instantly get insecure when the person i like likes another girl selfie or bikini pictures
half-assed efforts
all i ask
the battle will never end
it is never easy
my eyes are peeing
it is not easy to comfort someone with depression
it was bittersweet honey
it is almost two and i do not know what to do should i stay or should i go without you i am feeling low i am thinking about us
real love is never a waste of time
i feel so bad
it is what you do to me
times square cannot shine as bright as you
what was once lost cannot be found
ever since the day i met you
you need someone you adore
i cant believe that i could be so blind
you are too close
i gave my heart to a goddamn fool
do not make this all about you
i want to be with someone who never makes me doubt if he is being real or not
he tells her that she is nothing like the last one despite her past
because every time i see you i get nervous
real friends
it was beautiful thank you
my crush is such an attentive person it hurts
my day has been made thank you love you so much 
what time is it again
it has been rigged
still can't get over how this feels like children memory games
nope not overthinking not today
dammit tumblr is such a gold mine of memes and beautiful photos
my god anime
i cant even enjoy my sleep
my sweet brother who i am writing an essay about feminism for
why were clothes ever invented
my brother is so sweet pero i cant even do this for him
when i said i wanted to feel
why is feminism in arts hard to write about
rolls around in agony
dearest brother
rolls around in madnessand maybe emotionally scarring so institution it is or free school lolololol cat street plugs right there
they say it is very dramatic
then again i realize i will just be like my parents
these are the times i wish i could be a parent
i feel so bad sometimes for wishing i had really chill parents who did not plan my whole life for me i mean i know they are just concerned but i still wish they could have been this concerned when i was younger and in need of it
this place makes me panic i am not even trying to sleep right now i just am
i love it when my friends tell me stories
i cannot enjoy this yet maybe later
every time i close my eyes it hurts
can i be the person i date next i have so much misplaced love that i have been willing to give it is ridiculous
what if they feel like they are not good enough that is why i am like this
but i do not feel like writing
the earphones will really have to make a comeback
where that make a sad person happy by turning them into sushi rolls group of pics
note to self if the day is already bad enough
i hope you have a good read
because being okay is never actually okay it is just tucked in the back of my head
but sometimes i also want to stop trying to be okay
will somebody tell me a story tomorrow
so no words for tonight
it will be alright love it has always been we will even wear that big stupid jacket you love
one of these days
take your time and take care of yourself too
what is this upside down
he's still lying
it is done
last for two days
kids are scary
it is okay to not be part of the equation
i hope you are too good luck
when we do it is in the form of ridicule 
trying to save a kitten with an absentee mother using a small syringe and lactose free milk lol good luck to us
lol this cat is the metaphor for my life lord let him live please for inspiration
i am so scared that our kittens are going to die because they have an absentee mother

all of you bitches really better drop this homophobic shit in 2018 seriously you all really let a homophobic ass tweet thrive in 2017 that is a big ass problem thoughts get it together and do not bring that shit in the new year or else i’m gonna fuck all of your moms smh
my parenting goal is to give my children a childhood that they will not have to heal from
heres a reminder for you in 2018 dont beg for someone to stay save space for people who matter dont chase anyone accept what cannot be changed leave what is not good for you no matter what happen think positively give time for yourself and love yourself
cut off anyone who does not see your worth
fuck you if you think lgbtq representation in the media is forcing lgbt shit into your life when gay bisexual lesbian transexual children grow up hating themselves because all they see on tv is cisgender boy and girl relationships
wrong reasons to go into a relationship to fit into boost self-esteem to distract yourself to feel happy to complete yourself to end lonliness to end depression you do not go into a relationship to depend on someone you are more than that choose yourself
never stop thinking about you
no more toxic friendships in 2018 no more toxic relationships in 2018 and no more toxic thoughts in 2018 only toxic by britney spears in 2018

we are actually just sitting on the floor to get good background
it is okay it is okay to stop talking
i write to let it out
givers need to set limits because takers rarely do
then embrace it until the brokenness becomes a void that would not be able to overpower you anymore
sometimes you just need a break from everything
me it is okay
me to self why have lashes extensions when you can take care of your own lashes also you cannot afford shit too high maintenance
arguments and fucking fights every fucking christmas well
my drug is my baby

what do you do when you realise the one person you love more than life itself does not feel the same way about you anymore because your mental health problems have changed you i have given this man 21 years of my life
what do you do when you realise the one person you love more than life itself does not love you the same any more because your mental illness has changed you heartbroken
i wish i had the strength and the confidence to but i really dont
nothing better than a fish finger butty with really fresh bread

i do not know if this is a routine or caused by panic every monday
when it is time for us to meet again tell me i worked hard too
farewell & may you rest in peace
demons are real yet they have no real form they talk inside our heads they talk and talk and talk and talk but as soon as you give in it is over depression is a demon dwelling inside of us do not let it win talk to your friends family to someone
i never meant to be unfair
so please do not go on tell everybody it was easy the only difference was she was brave enough to tell me even when i was waiting for you
i know i was acting distant but i really was just waiting for you
stuck between happy and sad but still grateful for whatever is happening
so what will i eat for lunch
daughter duties before classes start

im so disoriented like yesterday i came in the office and it is locked because they are all drunk the last night then now i came in and we are moving out
anxiety attacks may be the key to skipping warm ups
my own inadequacy stresses me out more than anything so much hate
this was my peak
i wanna become less of an asshole next year
this sound makes me feel some type of way
i wanna be with you
what did i do to deserve oasis
sometimes we suddenly feel down for no apparent reason
something is wrong with me again i suddenly want to cry for no apparent reason
you are really missing out
i have done my part
so much drama is going on
life is weird
anyone interested to help us out
not all guys are fucking dogs who just care about getting laid
i did not think it was possible to give up on myself
quit making me cry damn
this feels so unreal
it cant be real life if i am this happy and it is 3 am
did that asshole xian gaza just take advantage of a sensitive issue to bring the spotlight back to him can anyone be more desperate for attention
loved and to be loved
me at 2 am spread the awareness anxiety  depression
so sick of love song so tired of tears
the next ti ame i get hell drunk someone needs to like hide my phone i fucking called and texted i do not know how many people last ti ame
i want a dog so i can bug my dog all the ti ame and it can get annoyed of me
i am going to be so mad if my phone is not sending text messages omg
i am gonna make myself cry if i keep watching these fucking videos
i regret eating 4 fat slices of pizza omg

i despise anxiety
i need a tight hug to cry
i need a hug

i am pretty disappointed in that look ugh
about to recreate another look

i am happy now
i hated myself after because i tried to get her back but she turned me down and i would give her flowers and write her cute shit and she ended up moving on but it makes me sad because she was there for me last year after my last breakup
back in middle school i felt really bad because my ex girlfriend was heavily all about me but i felt too afraid of being with her (dont know why because my mom used to be with a female so why would she hate on me) but i ended up breaking her heart eh
i dont need friends that are gonna make me temporary dont even bother if youre not planning to stick around
i always believe people are lying to me no matter what
i am so confused i do not know what to believe
honest to god if you want to be my friend just skip the awkward phase send me a meme and call me a bitch do it in the name of friendship
pats my own shoulder it is gonna be okay dumb bitch
you ever be like oh wow i am crazy
i hope for at least one more big 4 show before the end of slayer’s final tour it just would not be right anyone else with me
i envy you people who do not have a fucked up family
how is someone supposed to trust when they are constantly lied to 
how is someone supposed to stay loyal when they keep getting betrayed
how is someone supposed to think straight when they keep getting switched up on 
just want y ouall to remember i will fight any of you
every time i am faced with certain milestones i sometimes hear myself think it is character development time
somebody asked me to estimate something in ounces. i had to tell them i think in metric system
been deviating towards books in the nonfiction category i like real life situations written in an engaging tone
for 3 years i let my past dictate what i do in the present now it is time i let my present dictate my future
do not lie to yourself kasi
when you look back on 2017
i am really hopeless
it is proven and tested
how do you still do this to me
this is fucking sad goodbye passion because of lies spread and immaturity
god help me i am slipping again
i am home and i already wanna go back to ilocos
why must you always flatter my little heart
fucking love that movie
i wonder how much my perspective of the world would change if i switched eyeballs with someone.
i picked books over games this sembreak the tall stack of books in my room is calling me
happy holidays rest up this christmas break you deserve it
i wanna make a cover of i dreamed a dream
i was supposed to work on org shit
glad to see that some things never change you are still a petty fucking idiot
why do the people in this house not realize that i do not want small talk while i am so damn into the book i am reading
they will never understand what they do not know
so i was so  drunk last night i made a 10k bet with my ex that he would not marry his current girlfriend
confess already
it is not all roses
it is human nature to miss what is under your nose
very grateful to be raised by parents who never pressured us to excel in school it made learning a lifestyle that does not stop in school
time reveals which fights are worth it you almost have to run every possible frightening scenario and live though it to get past the fear time will guide
fuck season 5 is breaking my heart all over gain
damn i think im just going to accept the fact that i am going to gain weight over the break
do you still love her i cannot imagine the day i wont
i have never seen our table filled with so many pastries im hyperventilating
i am pretty sure he is here for somebody
i know
fuck you
nothing good really happens at this ungodly hour for example
sometimes i forget that i once had a boyfriend
i am finally getting rid of that semestral stress after that relaxing face mask session
face masks are weird
am i the only one craving for ice cream in this weather
ending this semester with a glass of gin
fuck i am done im going to sleep by world
i am still alive
don't lose your head before you get to wear the crown
i will be your quiet afternoon crush
i will never understand people who enjoy fisting
that is it i do not have a home anymore guys
guess what you are so close to surviving 2017 you can make it i am so proud that you are still here keep going buddy
if snails are so slow how come nobody sees them coming it is always like bam there is a snail
if you start listening to the voices inside ur head at exactly 11:58:43 on new year s eve you will realize by 12 mn that you are going to die alone and unloved
cannot run out of money if you have no money
all i have is low self esteem and good taste in music
people will be paired based on what they are studying distance and other factors
stay up talking to the moon been feeling so alone in every crowded room
why are all these people still alive i want what they qre smoking
i want to hang myself using my human entrails
seeing something you disapprove of doesv not give you the right to silence that thing or stop it from happening feel free to disagree or be frustrated do not shame other people from exercising democracy
you did not give the blood moon a blood sacrifice now prepare for natural disasters to befall us all
today has been the longest fucking day of my life and i just want to go to sleep forever
stopped working for a hour while i was trying to watch and i actually cried because that is the kind of day i have had lol
feeling very defeated lately no matter how hard i try
i had plans to see a good friend when she stops here on tour and now i have to work literally so bummed
missing someone who could care less about you is one of the shittiest feelings in the world
not being able to eat literally anything besides top ramen and crackers is driving me insane a bite of anything else makes me so sick
today has been rough i have been so happy lately but right now i am just an emo mess and nothing is helping me feel better
its real i cry
it is ok to fall
just do not ever forget to keep trying to move forward
when it is friday night and everyone is like yay let us go partying and i am all like yay
i do not know i really like party very much
i am on a rollercoaster
i cannot sleep
it is gonna be ok
i am pretty sure we need to touch the lowest ground to be totally able to get back up again
it really means more than i can say right now
thank you for these words
when those doubts are too strong
i am grateful and destroyed at the same time
depression does not mean i am always sad
i am okay
depression tells you you are hopeless and nothing is ever gonna change
you do not feel stronger because depression is like a veil that covers our potential keep fighting
it is not good to keep toxic people in your life
depression is to feel emotionally drained after overthinking about something
stay alive please
that makes us feel very good as well
that is exactly what fucks my mind
stealing is always intentional
and here we go again
i cannot stand this anymore
it is pretty tiring
i am just so tired
i seriously cannot believe it
keep going
music seems to fill the emptiness i sometimes feel inside
i m trying to change the perspective from which i look at anything that happens to me
i wish i did not trust another person who only tear my heart into pieces
it is ok to feel that way
depression is like a misty maze where you are stuck deep inside
bad experiences change our life i met panic attacks
my life was never the same after that
if someone keeps hurting and disappointing you
i totally understand that
that makes you a great
you are not alone
keep fighting for yourself
this is seriously beautiful
you two are beautiful
i personally think that depression makes grief harder if that is even possible
depression makes u think you are alone and nobody understands you
depression is to feel even more powerless when people call you lazy because they do not understand you are sick
depression is to get up from the bed to go lay on your sofa because you literally have no strength
depression is a mental illness
hate makes you cautious love makes you glow
the sun is shining and so are you
gonna sleep this hunger
i have no future sad life
gonna lose something
i will bleed if i have to
got a free salad and mango float
i will just keep myself busy as what i used to do
i never failed you ever
i won't run away anymore no matter how shaken it gets you always run with all your might in the end and we always end up standing in front of this beach hiding how we truly feel my one and only wish i pray until it reaches you it reaches you it reaches you
thankful for having someone constant
guys if you are about to do something or anything that can hurt people please think twice you cannot undo something you have done or you have said you cannot just tell people to forget it and expect them to be fine please be sensitive please do not abuse someone kindness
i will literally cancel plans just to stay at home and do nothing
finally someone said it
i desperately hope i just need to drink more water because i feel terrible
i feel empty
i feel like today is a lucky day but tonight not so much
i should have better control of myself starting now
i am at this point of my life that watching late night show of james corden makes me sane
i should not work when i am too sleepy
so i accidentally said fuck in front of a customer kill me kill me now
i am craving for giligan sinigang na baboy
you say you wanna chase the moon like fire well together we can fake our own deaths here
so thankful for the people around me thank you for everything guys
i should not make any decisions right now i swear
i think i need something to refresh
today is the day to mourn for
i was sexually abused twice me too
will do will try harder
how many more people are we going to lose before we take mental health seriously depression is real and it is killing people on a daily basis
i gotta move on and be who i am i just dont belong here i hope you understand
why am i still awake
our suggested sched for this sem requires a shift in our study routine oh dear lord
why do i feel like sleeping again
every smile you fake
how do you stay motivated with routinary work
patience is key but i am done witj being patient towards everybody
these are the days when i feel so happy at one moment and then sink into the dark pits of hell thinking i do not deserve to be happy or satisfied at all
about to make wrong decisions again
god help the allergic nose
i am just a poor girl nobody loves me
i do not wanna know if you are looking into her eyes
this is so sad extra sad
i swallow my words down to the bone cause nothing is that simple
